This is the code for the Texturejam web site <http://texturejam.org.uk/>

The purpose of this site is to facilitiate the sharing of recipes for remixing
texturepacks – the idea being to make it no longer necessary for people to
distribute modified packs (which contain artwork taken from packs made by
someone else). While I thought about hot to create a remixing UX I implemented
a few special-case recipes, such as for upgrading older packs to the latest
Minecraft version.

This project is currently on hiatus due to lack of interest – and the
existence of other sites that approach remixing texturepacks in a different
way.
